# KS Lawn Ranger — Starter Site (GitHub Pages)

This is a clean static site ready for a new repository.
- Assets live in `/images` and all paths are updated to use that folder.
- Includes `.nojekyll` and a minimal `404.html`.
- GA4 + Formspree pre-configured.

## Deploy
1) Create a new public repo (e.g., `kslawnranger-site`), then upload all files in this ZIP to the repo root.
2) Settings → Pages → Build and deployment:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
3) Open the Pages URL (something like `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>/`).
4) After it’s working, add a custom domain in Settings → Pages, then create a `CNAME` file with your domain (optional).
